## Task Runner

This project uses [just](https://github.com/casey/just) as its task runner. To see a list of available tasks, run `just`.

### Postgres Setup
The app uses postgres to store who's checked out what book from the library.

To set it up for local development, follow these steps:

1. Create a database within postgres. Type `sudo -u postgres psql` (or just `psql` on Mac) in your terminal to enter the postgres interpreter as the postgres user. This user has admin permissions to create more users.
2. Run `\du` to describe users.
3. Create a new user (called roles in postgres) with:

    `create role cap_hill_rust with login;`

4. Run `\du` to view the users again. You should see the new user.
4. Create the database:

    `create database cap_hill_rust with owner cap_hill_rust;`

6. Logout of psql:

    `\q`
